# Overview
A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization’s security systems.

The report in this directory will examine a scenario for the e-commerce company **PinnacleBuy** that will address a vulnerability to their database server.

# System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system, not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2022 to August 2022. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# Purpose
Consider the following questions:

● How is the database server valuable to the business?

● Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?

● How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?
