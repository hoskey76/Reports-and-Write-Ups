# Approach

Risks that were measured considered the data storage and management procedures of PinnacleBuy. Potential threat sources and events were determined using the likelihood of a security incident given the weak access controls of the database. The severity of potential threat events were determined based on the impact of the day-to-day operational needs of PinnacleBuy.


# Remediation Strategy

The security posture of the PinnacleBuy database system is less than subpar, remediation of security standards for the organization is imperative to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of not only the database by all internal systems. The implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing controls to ensure that only authorized users access the database server is advised. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. Revision of firewall controls to include IP allow-listing to corporate offices which would prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
