# Inspect the Contents
### Use Virtual Environment to Analyze USB Drive

### Examine Files

The device looks like it belongs to Jorge Lee, who is the human resource manager at St. Mary's Hospital.

The drive contains a mix of files, some personal and some work-related. Some of the files are clearly personal, like the folders containing *Family photos* or the document *Wedding list*. There are also some files that are clearly work-related like the spreadsheet *Employee budget* and the document *New hire letter*.



>[!IMPORTANT]
>USB drives often contain a variety of personally identifiable information (PII). Attackers can easily use this sensitive information to target an organization, the data owner, or others around them. 

# Use an Attacker's Mindset
*Consider how an attacker might use this information if obtained or whether this whole event was staged.*

1. The files could be there as a distraction to hide malware so an unsuspecting person views the files and then returns it to Jorge thinking it belongs to him.

2. The files could be used against Jorge, potentially as blackmail.
  
3. The drive may contain business information which could result in a leak of Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

4. The business information on the drive could be used to craft phishing attacks against the organization


# Risk Analysis
St. Maryâ€™s Hospital should conduct periodic training or send reminders to ensure employee awareness about these types of attacks and what to do when a suspicious USB drive is found. Employees should also be reminded of the need to protect Personal Identifiable Information (PII) which not only keeps the organization in compliance with HIPAA, but also protects the hospital and its patients. Setting up routine antivirus scans is an operational control that can be implemented. Another line of defense would be disabling AutoPlay on hospital PCs that will prevent a computer from automatically executing malicious code when a USB drive is plugged in.
